-- Global Timestamp Format. See "man 3 strftime" for more details:
--
-- The strftime() function formats the broken-down time tm
-- according to the format specification format and places the result
-- in the character array s of size max.
--
-- Ordinary characters placed in the format string are copied to s
-- without conversion. Conversion specifications are introduced by
-- a '%' character, and terminated by a conversion specifier
-- character, and are replaced in s as follows:
--
--  %a - The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.
--  %A - The full weekday name according to the current locale.
--  %b - The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.
--  %B - The full month name according to the current locale.
--  %c - The preferred date and time representation for the current locale.
--  %C - The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer. (SU)
--  %d - The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).
--  %D - Equivalent to %m/%d/%y. (Yecch -- for Americans only. Americans should note that in other countries %d/%m/%y is rather common.  This means that in international context this format is ambiguous and should not be used.) (SU)
--  %e - Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a leading zero is replaced by a space. (SU)
--  %E - Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)
--  %F - Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format). (C99)
--  %G - The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number. The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week number (see %V).  This has the same format and value as %y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead. (TZ)
--  %g - Like %G, but without century, that is, with a 2-digit year (00-99). (TZ)
--  %h - Equivalent to %b. (SU)
--  %H - The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).
--  %I - The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).
--  %j - The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).
--  %k - The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %H.) (TZ)
--  %l - The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %I.) (TZ)
--  %m - The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).
--  %M - The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).
--  %n - A newline character. (SU)
--  %O - Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)
--  %p - Either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the current locale. Noon is treated as "pm" and midnight as "am".
--  %P - Like %p but in lowercase: "am" or "pm" or a corresponding string for the current locale. (GNU)
--  %r - The time in a.m. or p.m. notation. In the POSIX locale this is equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p. (SU)
--  %R - The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). (SU) For a version including the seconds, see %T below.
--  %s - The number of seconds since the Epoch, that is, since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. (TZ)
--  %S - The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60). (The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)
--  %t - A tab character. (SU)
--  %T - The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S). (SU)
--  %u - The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1. See also %w. (SU)
--  %U - The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of week 01. See also %V and %W.
--  %V - The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at least 4 days in the current year, and with Monday as the first day of the week. See also %U and %W. (SU)
--  %w - The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0. See also %u.
--  %W - The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the first day of week 01.
--  %x - The preferred date representation for the current locale without the time.
--  %X - The preferred time representation for the current locale without the date.
--  %y - The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).
--  %Y - The year as a decimal number including the century.
--  %z - The time-zone as hour offset from GMT.  Required to emit RFC 822-conformant dates (using  "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z"). (GNU)
--  %Z - The time zone or name or abbreviation.
--  %+ - The date and time in date(1) format. (TZ) (Not supported in glibc2.)
--  %% - A literal '%' character.
--
-- Some conversion specifications can be modified by preceding the
-- conversion specifier character by the E or O modifier to indicate
-- that an alternative format should be used. If the alternative format
-- or specification does not exist for the current locale, the behavior
-- will be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used.
-- (SU) The Single Unix Specification mentions %Ec, %EC, %Ex, %EX, %Ey,
-- %EY, %Od, %Oe, %OH, %OI, %Om, %OM, %OS, %Ou, %OU, %OV, %Ow, %OW,
-- %Oy, where the effect of the O modifier is to use alternative
-- numeric symbols (say, roman numerals), and that of the E modifier is
-- to use a locale-dependent alternative representation.

    * ported from MagickCore to MagickWand, making thumbnail generation
      process more clean

    * possible to enable/disable in config
        * rewrite rules
        * cache in memory
    * thumbnails now have long expiration time, and have correct last
      modified date, which will (i hope) force browsers to cache them,
      decreasing server load by this
    * fixed memory leak when terminating threads, the create thread cycle makes
      the threadInfo, stores it and passes to thread, instead of just it's
      number
    * nncms will detect httpd and use appropriate number of newline at
      end of HTTP headers
